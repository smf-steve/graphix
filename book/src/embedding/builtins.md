# Writing Built in Functions

As mentioned in the introduction you can extend Graphix by writing
built in functions in Rust. This chapter will deep dive into the full
API. If you just want to write a pure function see the
[Overview](./overview.md), or better yet the
[Creating Packages](../packages/creating.md) guide.

Most users should create a [package](../packages/overview.md) rather
than using these traits directly. The `defpackage!` macro handles
registration and module setup automatically. This chapter is for
understanding the internals.

In order to implement a built-in Graphix function you must implement
two traits,
[`graphix_compiler::BuiltIn`](https://docs.rs/graphix-compiler/latest/graphix_compiler/trait.BuiltIn.html)
and
[`graphix_compiler::Apply`](https://docs.rs/graphix-compiler/latest/graphix_compiler/trait.Apply.html).
See the rustdoc for details. These two traits give you more control
than the `CachedArgs` method we covered in the overview. Lets look at
the simplest possible example.

## Understanding The Once Function

The `once` function evaluates its argument every cycle and passes
through one and only one update. The `update` method is the most
important method of `Apply`, it is called every cycle and returns
something only when the node being updated has "updated". The meaning
of that is specific to what the node does, but in the case of `once`
it means that the argument to `once` updated, and `once` has not
already seen an update. Consider the example program,

```graphix
let clock = sys::time::timer(1, true);
println(once(clock))
```

We expect this example to print the datetime exactly one time. Lets
dig in to how that actually works. The clock created by `sys::time::timer`
will tick once per second forever. The `sys::time::timer` built-in will
call `set_timer` in the
[`Rt`](https://docs.rs/graphix-compiler/latest/graphix_compiler/trait.Rt.html),
which is part of the
[`ExecCtx`](https://docs.rs/graphix-compiler/latest/graphix_compiler/struct.ExecCtx.html). This
will schedule a cycle to happen 1 second from now, and will also
register that this toplevel node (`let clock = ...`) depends on the
timer event. When the timer event happens the approximate sequence of
events is,

- let clock = sys::time::timer(1, true), update called on toplevel node (Bind)
    - sys::time::timer(1, true), bind calls update on its rhs
    - sys::time::timer checks events to see if it should update, returns Some(DateTime(..))
    - bind sets the id of clock in events to Value::DateTime(..)
    - Rt checks for nodes that depend on `clock` schedules println(..)
- println(once(clock)), update called on toplevel node (CallSite)
    - once(clock), println calls update on its argument, once(clock)
    - once::update calls update on clock
    - ref clock checks events to see if it updated, returns Some(Value::DateTime(..))
    - once::update checks if it's the first time its argument has updated, it is
    - once::update returns Some(Value::DateTime(..))
    - println prints the datetime

## Implementing Once

```rust
use anyhow::Result;
use graphix_compiler::{
    expr::ExprId, typ::FnType, Apply, BuiltIn, Event, ExecCtx, Node, Rt, Scope, UserEvent,
};
use netidx_value::Value;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Once {
    val: bool,
}

impl<R: Rt, E: UserEvent> BuiltIn<R, E> for Once {
    const NAME: &str = "core_once";

    fn init<'a, 'b, 'c>(
        _ctx: &'a mut ExecCtx<R, E>,
        _typ: &'a FnType,
        _resolved_typ: Option<&'a FnType>,
        _scope: &'b Scope,
        _from: &'c [Node<R, E>],
        _top_id: ExprId,
    ) -> Result<Box<dyn Apply<R, E>>> {
        Ok(Box::new(Once { val: false }))
    }
}

impl<R: Rt, E: UserEvent> Apply<R, E> for Once {
    fn update(
        &mut self,
        ctx: &mut ExecCtx<R, E>,
        from: &mut [Node<R, E>],
        event: &mut Event<E>,
    ) -> Option<Value> {
        match from {
            [s] => s.update(ctx, event).and_then(|v| {
                if self.val {
                    None
                } else {
                    self.val = true;
                    Some(v)
                }
            }),
            _ => None,
        }
    }

    fn sleep(&mut self, _ctx: &mut ExecCtx<R, E>) {
        self.val = false
    }
}
```

The `BuiltIn` trait is for construction. It declares the built-in's
name. The function's type is declared in the `.gx` file where the
builtin is bound — all arguments and the return type must be
annotated. For example, `once` would be bound as:

```graphix
let once = |v: 'a| -> 'a 'core_once
```

The `init` method is called when the built-in is instantiated at a
call site. It receives the execution context, the concrete function
type, the lexical scope, the argument nodes, and the top-level
expression id. In this case we don't care about any of that
information, but it will be useful later.

The most important method of `Apply` is `update`. `sleep` is expected to
reset all the internal state and unregister anything registered with
the context.

## Higher Order Functions

Right, now that the easy stuff is out of the way, lets see how we can
implement a built-in that takes another Graphix function as an
argument. This gets compiler guts all over the place, sorry about
that. Again lets look at the simplest example from the standard
library, which is `array::group`.

```rust
use anyhow::bail;
use compact_str::format_compact;
use graphix_compiler::{
    expr::ExprId,
    genn,
    node::Node,
    typ::{FnType, Typ, Type},
    Apply, BindId, BuiltIn, Event, ExecCtx, LambdaId, Refs, Rt, Scope, UserEvent,
};
use netidx_value::Value;
use smallvec::{smallvec, SmallVec};
use std::collections::VecDeque;

#[derive(Debug)]
pub(super) struct Group<R: Rt, E: UserEvent> {
    queue: VecDeque<Value>,
    buf: SmallVec<[Value; 16]>,
    pred: Node<R, E>,
    ready: bool,
    pid: BindId,
    nid: BindId,
    xid: BindId,
}

impl<R: Rt, E: UserEvent> BuiltIn<R, E> for Group<R, E> {
    const NAME: &str = "array_group";

    fn init<'a, 'b, 'c>(
        ctx: &'a mut ExecCtx<R, E>,
        typ: &'a FnType,
        _resolved_typ: Option<&'a FnType>,
        scope: &'b Scope,
        from: &'c [Node<R, E>],
        top_id: ExprId,
    ) -> Result<Box<dyn Apply<R, E>>> {
        match from {
            [_, _] => {
                let scope =
                    scope.append(&format_compact!("fn{}", LambdaId::new().inner()));
                let n_typ = Type::Primitive(Typ::I64.into());
                let etyp = typ.args[0].typ.clone();
                let mftyp = match &typ.args[1].typ {
                    Type::Fn(ft) => ft.clone(),
                    t => bail!("expected function not {t}"),
                };
                let (nid, n) =
                    genn::bind(ctx, &scope.lexical, "n", n_typ.clone(), top_id);
                let (xid, x) =
                    genn::bind(ctx, &scope.lexical, "x", etyp.clone(), top_id);
                let pid = BindId::new();
                let fnode =
                    genn::reference(ctx, pid, Type::Fn(mftyp.clone()), top_id);
                let pred = genn::apply(fnode, scope, vec![n, x], &mftyp, top_id);
                Ok(Box::new(Self {
                    queue: VecDeque::new(),
                    buf: smallvec![],
                    pred,
                    ready: true,
                    pid,
                    nid,
                    xid,
                }))
            }
            _ => bail!("expected two arguments"),
        }
    }
}

impl<R: Rt, E: UserEvent> Apply<R, E> for Group<R, E> {
    fn update(
        &mut self,
        ctx: &mut ExecCtx<R, E>,
        from: &mut [Node<R, E>],
        event: &mut Event<E>,
    ) -> Option<Value> {
        macro_rules! set {
            ($v:expr) => {{
                self.ready = false;
                self.buf.push($v.clone());
                let len = Value::I64(self.buf.len() as i64);
                ctx.cached.insert(self.nid, len.clone());
                event.variables.insert(self.nid, len);
                ctx.cached.insert(self.xid, $v.clone());
                event.variables.insert(self.xid, $v);
            }};
        }
        if let Some(v) = from[0].update(ctx, event) {
            self.queue.push_back(v);
        }
        if let Some(v) = from[1].update(ctx, event) {
            ctx.cached.insert(self.pid, v.clone());
            event.variables.insert(self.pid, v);
        }
        if self.ready && self.queue.len() > 0 {
            let v = self.queue.pop_front().unwrap();
            set!(v);
        }
        loop {
            match self.pred.update(ctx, event) {
                None => break None,
                Some(v) => {
                    self.ready = true;
                    match v {
                        Value::Bool(true) => {
                            break Some(Value::Array(
                                netidx_value::ValArray::from_iter_exact(
                                    self.buf.drain(..),
                                ),
                            ))
                        }
                        _ => match self.queue.pop_front() {
                            None => break None,
                            Some(v) => set!(v),
                        },
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    fn typecheck(
        &mut self,
        ctx: &mut ExecCtx<R, E>,
        _from: &mut [Node<R, E>],
    ) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
        self.pred.typecheck(ctx)
    }

    fn refs(&self, refs: &mut Refs) {
        self.pred.refs(refs)
    }

    fn delete(&mut self, ctx: &mut ExecCtx<R, E>) {
        ctx.cached.remove(&self.nid);
        ctx.cached.remove(&self.pid);
        ctx.cached.remove(&self.xid);
        self.pred.delete(ctx);
    }

    fn sleep(&mut self, ctx: &mut ExecCtx<R, E>) {
        self.pred.sleep(ctx);
    }
}
```

This implements `array::group`, which given an argument, stores that
argument's updates internally, and creates an array out of them when
the predicate returns true. Its type is

```fn('a, fn(i64, 'a) -> bool) -> Array<'a>```

For example,

```graphix
let n = seq(0, 100);
array::group(n, |_, n| (n == 50) || (n == 99))
```

`seq(0, 100)` updates 100 times from 0 to 99. The `array::group` will
create two arrays, one containing `[0, .. 50]` and the other
containing `[51, .. 99]`.

The implementation needs to build a `Node` representing the
predicate. `Node` is the fundamental type of everything in the graph.
Ultimately the entire program compiles to a node. The kind of node we
need to create here is a function call site, that will handle all the
details of late binding, optional arguments, default args, etc. The
`genn` module is specifically for generating nodes.

### Typecheck

Because we generated code, we have to hook into the `typecheck`
compiler phase and make sure the type checker runs on it. This
requires that we implement the `typecheck` method. In our case all we
have to do is typecheck our generated call site.

#### Two-Phase Typecheck for Higher-Order Functions

Higher-order builtins **must** return `TypecheckResult::NeedsCallSite`
and handle the `TypecheckPhase::CallSite(resolved)` phase. This is
required so that type information from the call site propagates
through to the inner predicate function. Without this, if the user
passes a builtin like `json::read` that requires a concrete return
type, the type checker won't be able to verify or initialize it.

The pattern is:

```rust
fn typecheck(
    &mut self,
    ctx: &mut ExecCtx<R, E>,
    _from: &mut [Node<R, E>],
    phase: TypecheckPhase<'_>,
) -> anyhow::Result<TypecheckResult> {
    // During CallSite phase, update stored types from the resolved FnType
    if let TypecheckPhase::CallSite(resolved) = phase {
        self.mftyp = match &resolved.args[PRED_INDEX].typ {
            Type::Fn(ft) => ft.clone(),
            t => bail!("expected a function not {t}"),
        };
        // Update any other stored types (element type, etc.)
    }
    // Create and typecheck the inner CallSite — this is critical
    // because it pushes deferred checks that cascade type information
    // to inner builtins (e.g. json::read getting its cast_typ set)
    let (_, node) = genn::bind(ctx, &self.scope.lexical, "x", self.etyp.clone(), self.top_id);
    let ft = self.mftyp.clone();
    let fnode = genn::reference(ctx, self.predid, Type::Fn(ft.clone()), self.top_id);
    let mut node = genn::apply(fnode, self.scope.clone(), vec![node], &ft, self.top_id);
    node.typecheck(ctx)?;
    node.delete(ctx);
    Ok(TypecheckResult::NeedsCallSite)
}
```

The `NeedsCallSite` return value tells the compiler to store this
builtin for deferred type checking. When the outer call site's
deferred check runs, it calls `typecheck(CallSite(resolved))` with
the fully resolved function type. The builtin updates its stored
predicate type (`mftyp`) from the resolved type, then creates and
typechecks an inner `CallSite` node. This inner typecheck pushes its
own deferred checks, cascading type information to any inner builtins
that need it.

For builtins that store a persistent predicate node (like `filter` or
`group`), the CallSite phase should rebuild the predicate node with
the resolved types, since the original was built with unresolved type
variables.

### BindIds and Refs

`BindId` is a very fundamental type in compiler guts. The
[`Event`](https://docs.rs/graphix-compiler/latest/graphix_compiler/struct.Event.html)
struct contains two tables indexed by it. The most important is `variables`.
Every bound variable has a `BindId`. If a variable has updated this cycle, then
its updated value will be in the `variables` table indexed by its `BindId`. In
order to call this predicate function we actually create three different
variables and store their `BindIds` as `xid`, `nid`, and `pid`.
`genn::reference` returns a reference `Node` and the `BindId` of the variable it
is referencing. Since those ref nodes become the arguments to the predicate call
site we create, `xid` and `nid` allow us to control the arguments passed into
the function. We just have to set `xid` and `nid` in `Event::variables` before
we update the predicate in order to `call` the function. This may cause it to
update immediately, or, it may depend on something else that needs to update
before it will update. Either way, once we've set `xid` and `nid` once and
called update on the predicate we've done our duty (it may never update, and
that's ok). That just leaves `pid`, what is it for? Well, earlier it was
mentioned that functions are always late bound. This is how that works. The
lambda argument we were passed `from[1]`, whatever kind of node it is, will
ultimately update and return a `Lambda`, which a compiled function. So every
cycle we need to call update on this node just like any other node, because the
`Lambda` we are calling might change, and if that happens the call site we
created with `genn::apply` needs to know about it. Luckily we don't have to
handle any of the wonderful details of late binding beyond this simple passing
through of updates, the call site will take care of that.

### ExecCtx::cached, refs, delete

What is all this `ctx.cached` stuff? Well, when call sites get
initialized for the first time, or when a branch of select wakes from
sleep, it turns out we need to know what the current value of every
variable they depend on is. Which means we need to cache globally the
current value of every variable. So if you're setting variables, 90%
chance you need to update cached.

And this also explains another function that you have to implement
when you're generating nodes, which is `refs`. Turns out we need to know
all the variables a node depends on, so we can set them when it's
being woken up from sleep, or stood up at a call site for the first
time.

That just leaves `delete`. The structure of the graph changes at
runtime, and we need to keep everything straight. It would be nice if
we could do this with `Drop`, but that would require holding a
reference to the `ExecCtx` at every `Node`. I'd really rather not pay
to wrap every access to the context in a mutex, so we're doing it the
hard way (for now).
